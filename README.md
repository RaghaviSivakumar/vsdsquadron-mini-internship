# Vsdsquadron-mini-internship
The VSDSquadron Mini is a tiny RISC-V development board. It features a 32-bit RISC-V core, multiple clock options, 15 GPIO pins, and various communication ports like SPI and I2C.
## FEATURES
* Processor: 32-bit RISC-V core (RV32EC instruction set)
* Clock: Built-in 24MHz RC oscillator (x2 options), external oscillator slot
* Memory: 2KB SRAM, 16KB Flash.
* I/O: 15 GPIO pins
* Communication Interface: USART, I2C, SPI
## TASK 1
To install the RISC-V toolchain using VDI, write a C code to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N and analyse the risc assembly code.
